Subject: Escalation: Multiple Service Failures

Dear Support,

This is to bring to your urgent attention a series of ongoing problems affecting our operations:

1. The billing system has failed for over 72 hours, resulting in delayed payments to over 500 vendors.
2. Our compliance team has flagged multiple unauthorized access attempts, which may constitute a fraud risk.
3. Several users have reported data loss, which could be a violation of GDPR and other regulatory frameworks.
4. Despite repeated requests, no resolution has been provided. This is not acceptable.

We require immediate escalation to your senior management. If this is not resolved within 24 hours, we will consider legal action and report to authorities.

Sincerely,
John Doe
CEO, Global Enterprise
